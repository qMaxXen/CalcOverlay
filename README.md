A Java program that generates an image displaying the certainty percentage of hitting the stronghold, the coordinates of the Nether portal, and the distance to the stronghold portal.

## How to use

1. Enable API in Ninjabrainbot. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe684b8b-1601-4dc9-86be-97160a964954)
2. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/qMaxXen/CalcOverlay/releases/tag/v1.0.0) section of this repository and download **CalcOverlay-1.0.1.jar**.
3. Move the .jar file to a convenient location and run it. An image will be generated in the same folder where the **CalcOverlay-1.0.1.jar** is located.
4. Add the generated image as an **image source** in OBS Studio.
